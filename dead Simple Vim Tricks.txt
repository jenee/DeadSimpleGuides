dead simple vim tricks


ESC: Go into command mode

lower-case i: go into insert mode

Insert Mode Tricks:


Autocomplete (for existing variable names):  
	CTRL-N after you've started typing something, to pull up a dropdown of possible autocompletions
	Up Arrow or CTRL-P to navigate UP dropdown list *
	Down Arrow or CTRL- N to navigate DOWN dropdown list *
	Continue typing ANY CHARACTER to accept selected autocompletion in dropdown:  It'll insert the selected autocompletion before whatever character you typed. I tend to prefer to type SPACE to get the dropdown out of my way.
	Extra, edge-case info: You can also press delete or backspace on an auto-completed term while the dropdown is still up, to broaden your search. 

* CTRL-P and Up Arrow aren't *exactly* analogous, nor are CTRL-N and Down arrow. CTRL-N and CTRL-P substitute the autocompletion in-line as they navigate through the dropdown selections.  The arrow keys change the selected string on the dropdown menu, but do not substitute the selections in-line until the autocompletion is done.  

Command Mode Tricks:

	u (lower case)
Redo
	CTRL-r (lower case)
